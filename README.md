# midi_Controller

a simple midi controller, designed to work with Meris' Preset Switch and Polymoon Delay.

--> Sends midi PC's to get acces to all 16 presets.
--> If you want to use an expression pedal, you need to adjust the code. Set your preferd CC.
--> This is an external device. For the built-in solution visit my other github repository.
